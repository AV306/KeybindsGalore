## "Illegal" keys

These are keys where a pie menu would obstruct basic function, and as such are (currently) hardcoded not to open a pie menu, even if they are bound to multiple actions.

These keys are currently:

- Tab (the player list doesn't toggle, so it woukd only show for a frame or two if you multibound Tab and selected the "List Plaayers" option)
- WASD (these are movement keys, and a pie menu would absolutely wreck their behaviour)
- Shift/Control (pretty much everyone I've met uses these as sprint/sneak, and like WASD, a pie menu would break them)
- Space (technically, this one is fine, but I haven't met anyone who uses Space for anything other than jump)

HVB007 also disabled pie menus for CapsLock and left Alt, but I chose to allow pie menus for them for the following reasons:

- Most people don't use them for anything important, and it was nice to have the extra keys for pie menus.
- I use about 90 mods, and they have enough actions to fill my entire keyboard and then some, so I needed all the keys I could get; Left Alt is a neat key because it's so close to my thumb, and I was mildly annoyed that I couldn't put a pie menu on it.
