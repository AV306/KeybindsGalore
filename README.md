- Label texts no longer run off the screen
- Fully customisable pie menu
- Allows compatibility with non-vanilla keybinds (insert your keybinds into the [conflict table](https://github.com/AV306/KeybindsGalore-Plus/blob/1.21/src/main/java/me/av306/keybindsgaloreplus/KeybindManager.java) whenever convenient!)
