# MultiBind

> This project is a fork of KeybindsGalore, originally by Cael and updated to 1.20 by HVB007.

> The project from which this is forked from can be found [here](https://github.com/HVB007og/KeybindsGalore_HVB007_1.20.x), and the [original project is here](https://github.com/CaelTheColher/KeybindsGalore).

This mod opens a pie menu when a key bound to multiple actions is pressed! No more weird behaviour on conflicting keys :D

[TODO: GIF of pie menu]

<br>

## Modifications to Original

- Reduced the list of keys, which when pressed, will not open a pie menu (more details [here](docs.md))
- Slightly optimised conflict searching and rendering
- Keybind labels now show their category along with their name, for easier identification of exactly what action it triggers ([example](docs.md))
- Added a small region (deadzone) at the centre of the pie menu that will not activate any binding (roughly 20px)

<br>

## Coming soon

- Configuration system for pie menu radius, transparency, animation and color

[TODO: GIF of pie menu opening, a sector being selected, and the action triggering]

[TODO: GIF of pie menu opening, cursor moving out of and back into the deadzone, and the pie menu closing without any action happening]

[TODO: GIF of pie menu opening, cursor moving through each sector in a clockwise manner, selecting one and closing the menu]
