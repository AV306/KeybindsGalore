This Fabric mod gives keys with to multiple conflicting keybindings a **pie menu** (aka pizza menu, circle selector, etc) that lets you choose the *desired action* when the key is pressed!

It also corrects the default keybind conflict behaviour for keys that you choose to not open a pie menu, so they will activate **all** bindings when pressed (and not just whichever one happened to be attached to the key last), similar to [Keybinds Fix].

Supports 1.21, and works on Neoforge with Sinytra Connector!
